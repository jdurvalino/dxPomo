## 🚀 Planned Features

### 1️⃣ macOS Notifications

Display native macOS notifications when:
- A focus session ends
- A break session ends
- An automatic cycle sequence is completed

Notifications will be **optional** and **configurable**, allowing users to enable or disable them according to their workflow.



### 2️⃣ Break Session Confirmation
Before starting a break session, the application will prompt the user for confirmation:

```
Focus session completed.
Start break now? (y/n)
```

This feature gives users greater control over their workflow and helps prevent unintended break sessions.
